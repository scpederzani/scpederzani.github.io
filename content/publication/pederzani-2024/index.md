abstract: The spread of *Homo sapiens* into new habitats across Eurasia ~45,000 years
  ago and the concurrent disappearance of Neanderthals represents a critical evolutionary
  turnover in our species’ history. ‘Transitional’ technocomplexes, such as the Lincombian–Ranisian–Jerzmanowician
  (LRJ), characterize the European record during this period but their makers and
  evolutionary significance have long remained unclear. New evidence from Ilsenhöhle
  in Ranis, Germany, now provides a secure connection of the LRJ to H. sapiens remains
  dated to ~45,000 years ago, making it one of the earliest forays of our species
  to central Europe. Using many stable isotope records of climate produced from 16
  serially sampled equid teeth spanning ~12,500 years of LRJ and Upper Palaeolithic
  human occupation at Ranis, we review the ability of early humans to adapt to different
  climate and habitat conditions. Results show that cold climates prevailed across
  LRJ occupations, with a temperature decrease culminating in a pronounced cold excursion
  at ~45,000–43,000 cal bp. Directly dated H. sapiens remains confirm that humans
  used the site even during this very cold phase. Together with recent evidence from
  the Initial Upper Palaeolithic, this demonstrates that humans operated in severe
  cold conditions during many distinct early dispersals into Europe and suggests pronounced
  adaptability.
