abstract: Recent excavations at Ranis (Germany) identified an early dispersal of Homo
  sapiens into the higher latitudes of Europe by 45,000 years ago. Here we integrate
  results from zooarchaeology, palaeoproteomics, sediment DNA and stable isotopes
  to characterize the ecology, subsistence and diet of these early H. sapiens. We
  assessed all bone remains (n = 1,754) from the 2016–2022 excavations through morphology
  (n = 1,218) or palaeoproteomics (zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (n = 536) and
  species by proteome investigation (n = 212)). Dominant taxa include reindeer, cave
  bear, woolly rhinoceros and horse, indicating cold climatic conditions. Numerous
  carnivore modifications, alongside sparse cut-marked and burnt bones, illustrate
  a predominant use of the site by hibernating cave bears and denning hyaenas, coupled
  with a fluctuating human presence. Faunal diversity and high carnivore input were
  further supported by ancient mammalian DNA recovered from 26 sediment samples. Bulk
  collagen carbon and nitrogen stable isotope data from 52 animal and 10 human remains
  confirm a cold steppe/tundra setting and indicate a homogenous human diet based
  on large terrestrial mammals. This lower-density archaeological signature matches
  other Lincombian–Ranisian–Jerzmanowician sites and is best explained by expedient
  visits of short duration by small, mobile groups of pioneer H. sapiens.
