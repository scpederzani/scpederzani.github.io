abstract: The behavioral dynamics underlying the expansion of Homo sapiens into Europe
  remains a crucial topic in human evolution. Owing to poor bone preservation, past
  studies have strongly focused on the Initial Upper Paleolithic (IUP) stone tool
  record. Recent excavations and extensive radiocarbon dating at Bacho Kiro Cave (Bulgaria)
  pushed back the arrival of IUP H.Â sapiens into Europe to ca. 45,000 years ago. This
  site has exceptional bone preservation, and we present the study of 7431 faunal
  remains from across two IUP layers (I and J) and one Middle Paleolithic layer (K).
  We identified a shift in site use and occupation intensity through time, marked
  by increased find density and human modifications in Layer I. Alongside a decrease
  in carnivore presence and seasonality data demonstrating human presence in all seasons,
  this indicates a more frequent or prolonged occupation of the site by IUP groups.
  Contrarily, the dietary focus across the IUP and Middle Paleolithic layers is similar,
  centered on the exploitation of species from a range of habitats including Bos/Bison,
  Cervidae, Equidae, and Caprinae. While body parts of large herbivores were selectively
  transported into the site, the bear remains suggest that these animals died in the
  cave itself. A distinct aspect of the IUP occupation is an increase in carnivore
  remains with human modifications, including these cave bears but also smaller taxa
  (e.g., Canis lupus, Vulpes vulpes). This can be correlated with their exploitation
  for pendants, and potentially for skins and furs. At a broader scale, we identified
  similarities in subsistence behavior across IUP sites in Europe and western Asia.
  It appears that the first IUP occupations were less intense with find densities
  and human modifications increasing in succeeding IUP layers. Moreover, the exploitation
  of small game appears to be limited across IUP sites, while carnivore exploitation
  seems a recurrent strategy.
