abstract: Subarctic climate at an early H. sapiens site in Europe shows that expansion
  of our species was not predicated on warm climates. The expansion of Homo sapiens
  across Eurasia marked a major milestone in human evolution that would eventually
  lead to our species being found across every continent. Current models propose that
  these expansions occurred only during episodes of warm climate, based on age correlations
  between archaeological and climatic records. Here, we obtain direct evidence for
  the temperatures faced by some of these humans through the oxygen isotope analysis
  of faunal remains from Bacho Kiro Cave, Bulgaria, the earliest clear record of H.
  sapiens in Europe. The results indicate that humans âˆ¼45,000 years ago experienced
  subarctic climates with far colder climatic conditions than previously suggested.
  This demonstrates that the early presence of H. sapiens in Europe was not contingent
  on warm climates. Our results necessitate the revision of key models of human expansion
  and highlight the need for a less deterministic role of climate in the study of
  our evolutionary history.
