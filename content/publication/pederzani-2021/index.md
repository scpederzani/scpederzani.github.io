abstract: Exploring the role of changing climates in human evolution is currently
  impeded by a scarcity of climatic information at the same temporal scale as the
  human behaviors documented in archaeological sites. This is mainly caused by high
  uncertainties in the chronometric dates used to correlate long-term climatic records
  with archaeological deposits. One solution is to generate climatic data directly
  from archaeological materials representing human behavior. Here we use oxygen isotope
  measurements of Bos/Bison tooth enamel to reconstruct summer and winter temperatures
  in the Late Pleistocene when Neandertals were using the site of La Ferrassie. Our
  results indicate that, despite the generally cold conditions of the broader period
  and despite direct evidence for cold features in certain sediments at the site,
  Neandertals used the site predominantly when climatic conditions were mild, similar
  to conditions in modern day France. We suggest that due to millennial scale climate
  variability, the periods of human activity and their climatic characteristics may
  not be representative of average conditions inferred from chronological correlations
  with long-term climatic records. These results highlight the importance of using
  direct routes, such as the high-resolution archives in tooth enamel from anthropogenically
  accumulated faunal assemblages, to establish climatic conditions at a human scale.
