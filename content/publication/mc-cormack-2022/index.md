abstract: Diet is a crucial trait of an animal’s lifestyle and ecology. The trophic
  level of an organism indicates its functional position within an ecosystem and holds
  significance for its ecology and evolution. Here, we demonstrate the use of zinc
  isotopes (δ66Zn) to geochemically assess the trophic level in diverse extant and
  extinct sharks, including the Neogene megatooth shark (Otodus megalodon) and the
  great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias). We reveal that dietary δ66Zn signatures
  are preserved in fossil shark tooth enameloid over deep geologic time and are robust
  recorders of each species’ trophic level. We observe significant δ66Zn differences
  among the Otodus and Carcharodon populations implying dietary shifts throughout
  the Neogene in both genera. Notably, Early Pliocene sympatric C. carcharias and
  O. megalodon appear to have occupied a similar mean trophic level, a finding that
  may hold clues to the extinction of the gigantic Neogene megatooth shark.
