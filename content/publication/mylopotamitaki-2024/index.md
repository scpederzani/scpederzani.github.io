abstract: The Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition in Europe is associated with
  the regional disappearance of Neanderthals and the spread of Homo sapiens. Late
  Neanderthals persisted in western Europe several millennia after the occurrence
  of H. sapiens in eastern Europe1. Local hybridization between the two groups occurred,
  but not on all occasions. Archaeological evidence also indicates the presence of
  several technocomplexes during this transition, complicating our understanding and
  the association of behavioural adaptations with specific hominin groups. One such
  technocomplex for which the makers are unknown is the Lincombian–Ranisian–Jerzmanowician
  (LRJ), which has been described in northwestern and central Europe. Here we present
  the morphological and proteomic taxonomic identification, mitochondrial DNA analysis
  and direct radiocarbon dating of human remains directly associated with an LRJ assemblage
  at the site Ilsenhöhle in Ranis (Germany). These human remains are among the earliest
  directly dated Upper Palaeolithic H. sapiens remains in Eurasia. We show that early
  H. sapiens associated with the LRJ were present in central and northwestern Europe
  long before the extinction of late Neanderthals in southwestern Europe. Our results
  strengthen the notion of a patchwork of distinct human populations and technocomplexes
  present in Europe during this transitional period.
